# Gall Bladder Machine Learning Predictor

Welcome to the **Gall Bladder Machine Learning Predictor** repository!  
This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a machine learning algorithm using Python and Streamlit.

## Overview

This repository contains:

- A machine learning model (built in Python) for predicting or classifying data related to gall bladder analysis.
- A user-friendly [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) web app for interacting with the model.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Ingests and preprocesses your dataset for optimal model performance.
- **Model Training**: Uses robust machine learning techniques (e.g., scikit-learn) to train a predictive model.
- **Web Deployment**: Deploys the model with a Streamlit app, enabling real-time predictions through your browser.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timoachal/gall-bladder.git
cd gall-bladder
```

### 2. Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 4. Access the App

Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)).

## File Structure

```
.
├── app.py                # Main Streamlit app
├── model.py              # Machine learning model code
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
├── README.md             # This file
└── data/                 # (Optional) Directory for datasets
```

## Example

Once you run the app, you can upload data or input values and receive instant predictions based on the trained model.

## Deployment

The app is built with Streamlit, making it easy to deploy on services like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or your own server.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **scikit-learn** (or your ML library of choice)
- **Streamlit**
